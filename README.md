# datavizprepkc-og-countdown
This is the original countdown splash page we used when launching datavizprepkc. It includes initial info on the competitions and a countdown to the big website reveal. 


This project is a precursor of [datavizprepkc](https://datavizprepkc.org/).

This project was created in collaboration with high school students involved in Pathways to Tech at [prepkc](https://prepkc.org/).
